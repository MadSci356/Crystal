Here is the setup for the faces

Atom 1
...
Atom 2
...
Atom n
...
Bonds
...
end file

Information you have:
- Atoms unique numbers
- numbers of atoms for each atom
- tuple of colors


Things you need to do:

1) Add the color line before the start of Atom 1, 2,..,n faces
2) Assign each of the atoms a color--probably based on index of the unique numbers


How to achieve 2):
- say you are painting atom n 
- color = color-list[unique-nums.index(atoms[n].number) % len(color-list)]

how to achieve 1):
- set face_to_edit = (start of faces)
- Go through the list of atoms:
- For each atom:
	pick color based on current atom.number (see (2))
	modify line at face_to_edit with color
	face_to_edit += number of faces for current atom (based on atom.centers probably)
